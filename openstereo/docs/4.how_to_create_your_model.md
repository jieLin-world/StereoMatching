## A new model
If you want to design a new model, you need to write a class inherited from `BaseModel`, e.g, NewModel in `newmodel.py`:
```python
from ..base_model import BaseModel

class NewModel(BaseModel):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def build_network(self):
        self.net = ...

    def forward(self, inputs):
        ref_img = inputs["ref_img"]
        tgt_img = inputs["tgt_img"]
        
        res = self.net(ref_img, tgt_img)
        
        return {
            "training_disp": {
                "disp_est": res,
                "disp_hidden": ...,
            },
            "inference_disp": {
                "disp_est": res,
            },
            "visual_summary": {
                ...
            }
        }

```
 In your model class, at least you need to implement `build_network()` and `forward()` functions. The first is used to build the netwroks, and it does not need `return value`. Another is used to calculate the features, the `return value` is fixed in dictionary format

> `training_disp` is for the loss computing, and it must be a `dict` object. 
> 
> `visual_summary` is for visualization, and it must be a `dict` object. 
> 
> `inference_disp` is for the inference, and it must be a `dict` object.

More information should be seen in [base_model.py](../opengait/modeling/base_model.py) and [loss_aggregator.py](../opengait/modeling/loss_aggregator.py).

After finishing the model file, you have several steps left to do:

**Step 1**: Put your newmodel.py under `openstereo/modeling/models`.

**Step 2**: Resister your model by importing your model in `openstereo/modeling/models/__init__.py`.

*Note that the Name of the imported class is the name you should use in the yaml file.*

**Step 3**: Specify the model name in a yaml file:
```yaml
model_cfg:
  model: NewModel
  param1: ...
  param2: ...
  param3: ...
```

## A new loss 
**This part is not finished yet. Please rewrite get_loss function.**

If you want to write a new loss, you need to write a class inherited from `opengait/modeling/losses`, like this
```python
from .base import BaseLoss

class NewLoss(BaseLoss):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        super(NewLoss, self).__init__(*args, **kargs)

    def forward(self,  disp_ests, disp_gt, mask=None):
        pass
```
Then, resister your model by importing your model in `openstereo/modeling/losses/__init__.py`.

*Note that the Name of the imported class is the name you should use in the yaml file.*

Moreover, refer to [loss_aggregator.py](../opengait/modeling/loss_aggregator.py) to explore how does your loss work in the model.
